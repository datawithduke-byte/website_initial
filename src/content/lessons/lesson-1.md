This is the first in Spreadsheet fundamentals.

WARNING! Once you've got your head around spreadsheets, you'll want to put EVERYTHING in a Table... I mean seriously, you'll be showing your kids your latest sheet before you know it!

But if you dare, this is the first lesson in spreadsheet fundamentals. I'm using Google Chrome specifically because it's FREE and easy to get on your phone as well as a laptop, PC, Tablet.. whatever.

I'll definitely be doing a more advanced series using Excel because that tool can do stuff you wouldn't believe! But for learning the basics and even more than that, this tool is really amazing!
