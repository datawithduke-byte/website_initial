Everything's gotta have a beginning, but sometimes in life as well as in Data, knowing how to start is often the biggest challenge. 

But where would we be without A, B, C or 1, 2, 3? Or even Do, Re, Mi?

So I'll start at the very beginning. It's a very good place to start (points for knowing the reference, bonus points for singing it!)

Several years ago, in the hay-day of pandemic lockdowns, I dabbled in a career hobby in content creation. I had a lot of fun, made some friends and earned the nickname 'Duke'.

Lockdowns ended and eventually, alongside a rapid development of my career, so did my dreams of being an overnight, sensational influencer.

However, as my career grew and developed, taking my skills as a communicator and a Data aficionado, and my experience as a content creator, I played with the idea of pushing the two candles together to create a bigger flame... Or a meltdown!

So here we are! With a goal of lighting the room or needing to call the fire service (whichever comes first).

My first podcast, Just What IS Data? is available and is the 'Do' to the 'Re, Mi'. Because what I've noticed in my (cough, cough) several years of life is the are a LOT of misconceptions about that word. Over the next weeks and months we'll be working to show that 'Data' isn't this magical, mystical and inaccessible thing. And with a little effort, you'll be taking ownership of the data that impacts your life too.

See you soonish.
